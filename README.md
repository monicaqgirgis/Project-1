# The Driving Question
Have colon cancer rates increased over the last few years in the US

## The embedded questions to help form the final analysis
1. 
2. 
3. 

# Our Hypothesis 
Colon Cancer(excluding rectum) diagnosis rates have increased in the US over the last few years despite the continual advancement of modern medicine.

## The breakdown
1. A trend line that shows the rise or fall of cases over time. 
Does colon cancer diagnosis have a clear rise, or fall, or do they remain consistent over the years?
Are there certain variables that have a clear rise or fall, if the whole does not?
2. Data visuals filtered age.
What age or age groups are diagnosed with colon cancer the least, and what age group is diagnosed with colon cancer the most?
4. Data visuals filtered by the medical term for Sex.
Which sex is typically diagnosed with colon cancer the most, and which sex is diagnosed with colon cancer the least?
5. Data visuals filtered by ethnicity.
Again, which ethnicity is most likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer at various stages? Is there no clear distinction?

^ All the questions are probing, and may develop as the code does.
