# The Driving Question
Have colon cancer rates increased over the last few years in the US

## The embedded questions to help form the final analysis
1. What year has the most cancer cases?​ What has the least? Is there a specific trend? 
2. What age is cancer most prevalent?
3. What race is most affected by cancer?​ What trend are we seeing in these specific populations?
4. What sex has an increased risk for cancer?​ What trends are we seeing in accordance to each sex?
   

# Our Hypothesis 
Colon Cancer(excluding rectum) diagnosis rates have increased in the US over the last few years despite the continual advancement of modern medicine.
 

# Conclusion and findings 
It has been found that the hypothesis is primarily correct as well as incorrect. There is a decreasing trend in regional colon cancer cases, excluding rectum overall in the demographics we explored. However, and most importantly, there has been a spike in regional cases from 2021 to 2022. It is acknowledged that there would need to be further analysis of the years following 2022 to determine whether or not there is an increasing trend, but there is a noticeable Spike from the noted years. While creating a further analysis, it was discovered from 2005 to 2022 colon cancer was most prevalent in ages 50 to 85 and up, White individuals were more likely to be diagnosed with regional cancer, and females were 51% more likely to be diagnosed.
